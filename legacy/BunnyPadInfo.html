        <h1>What is BunnyPad?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>BunnyPad is an innovative alternative of Windows' Notepad/WordPad dedicated to GarryStraitYT's Best friend, PBbunnypower (Bunny). Development is ongoing, and the app currently is on version 6, which is known as EggHunt.</p>
        <br>
        <h1> How do I download BunnyPad?</h1>
        <p>You can download BunnyPad from
        <a href="https://garrystraityt.itch.io/bunnypad">here</a></p>
        <br>
        <h1>Only your friends or people from Discord will download it.</h1>
        <p>As it currently stands, BunnyPad has 85 downloads. I, however, only have a maximum of 10 friends. The tech director at Otto-Eldred is one such download. </p>

        <h1>When is the next update going to be released?</h1>
        <p>Version 7, which has yet to be codenamed, will be released in September.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Why did you switch from NSIS to Inno Setup after version 1?</h1>
        <p>Well, upon running the NSIS Installer in VirusTotal, we discovered that NSIS modified our program to "phone" an IP address we did not recognize. We at GSYT Productions saw this as a breach of our terms, and thus discontinued NSIS from being used for our products, and switched to Inno as it does not phone any IP addresses, is more customizeable, and has less of a detection rate in VirusTotal.</p>
